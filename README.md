# dogGo - Legacy
### created by Martin West - [GitHub](https://github.com/martinwest1993) - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinwest1993/)

dogGo is an application that allows users to search pet stores, vets and groomers; book pet friendly hotels and sitters and give recommendations on the best places to walk your pets. 

I had the amazing opportunity along with Alisha Jungah to contribute to this Legacy project, adding testing, styles improvements and refactoring the application to TypeScript.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/karenplanas/dogGo.git
  ```
  
2. Install dependencies in root, server and client folder.
```
npm install
```

3. DB requirements: You need to have a MongoDB server running, either [locally](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/server/install/), or on the [cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), to connect to.

4. Create .env file in the server folder and set the [Mongodb URI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)
```
MONGO_URI=
```

5. Start the server. From the server folder, run
```
npm start
```
  
6. Start the client. From the client folder, run
```
npm start
```
